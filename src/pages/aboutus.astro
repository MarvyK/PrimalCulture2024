          <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
          <p>
            Situated in the rugged up market tranquil suburb of Diep River with a bodacious sensory overload to peak one's consciousness. The location is bright, flavourful, harmonic and fresh
            surroundings which makes it tangible to the soul therefore we have moved close to the 3 Arts Village Mall (spoiler alert no paintings or sculptures on display). <br /> Our birds on the premises
            tweets in English (yet 10 minutes from our location the local birds “kwaat” in another language). <br /> For your safety and ours Diep River Police Station is 2 minutes away.

          <p>
            The atmosphere in the studio is what we want with an eclectic range of treffers, known as the “HOME OF YAADT” (with copies from an array of dee-jays and wanna be dee-jays), often wishing
            to be "two places at the same time", as one of our staff was the original guy to take the broom and sweep the yard. From the soft soothing “binne boud” jams to the hard biting the head off
            an innocent locust tunes with the occasional seasonal dependent jams from Boney M during Christmas, Jaloos Bokkie on National Braai Day to even that elusive Kat Stevens jams on those two
            special days in the year ;), to also catering to our own local African treffers. In the evening there is a soothing atmospheric neon illumination which gives the studio an Amsterdam like
            nostalgia bringing a “fuzzy” feeling to oneself.

          <h1>Q: WHY DOES MY TATTOO BLEED?</h1>
          <p>
            A:That's what happens when a needle goes into your skin. Our Staff are locally bred with imported seed, native to the indigenous Khoisan soil blown from the winds of the Cape of Storms,
            once voted the no.1 most popular place to visit in 1652 by Jan van Riebeek (V.O.C) , and they are well-travelled individuals (Home to work and back again mostly). We once formed a
            vigilante superhero group called ‘The Pretenders’ but disbanded at the end of the game. None of ‘The Pretenders’ were billionaires (who could afford fancy gadgets) or orphans or had any
            sort of super power but was rumoured to be able to stop a bullet at least once. Medication dependent, at the right dose, between naps, we will give you service of value. We once rated
            ourselves 4.8 stars (we think we overrated! ). Armed with a highly equipped standard occasionally fully functional upgraded Windows 8 software programmed computer system with a very low
            speeded internet connection and refurbished dot matrix printer we can almost find any picture you found. With customer satisfaction is occasionally guaranteed: So if beards offend you,
            we’ll make the bastard (Artist) shave :D (Labour laws pending) If the artist likes you he/she will answer all questions in interpretive dance. We also always almost have a lifeguard on
            duty so the chances of you drowning while getting tattooed is “very slim”.
