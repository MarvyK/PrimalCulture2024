          <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
          <p>
            Situated in the rugged up market tranquil suburb of Diep River with a bodacious sensory overload to peak one's consciousness. The location is bright, flavourful, harmonic and fresh
            surroundings which makes it tangible to the soul therefore we have moved close to the 3 Arts Village Mall (spoiler alert no paintings or sculptures on display). <br /> Our birds on the premises
            tweets in English (yet 10 minutes from our location the local birds ‚Äúkwaat‚Äù in another language). <br /> For your safety and ours Diep River Police Station is 2 minutes away.

            The atmosphere in the studio is what we want with an eclectic range of treffers. <br />
            From the soft soothing ‚Äúbinne boud‚Äù jams to the hard biting the head off an innocent locust tunes with occasional seasonal dependant jams from Boney M during Christmas, Jaloos Bokkie on National
            Braai Day to even that elusive Kat Stevens jams on those two special days in the year üòâ, to also catering to our own local African treffers. <br /><br />In the evening there is a soothing
            atmospheric neon illumination which gives the studio an Amsterdam like nostalgia bringing a fuzzy feeling to oneself.

          <h2>Q: WHY DOES MY TATTOO BLEED?</h2>
          <h3 class="secondary-color">A: That's what happens when a needle goes into your skin.</h3>
          <p>
            Out staff are locally breed with imported seed, native to the indigenous Khoi San soil blown from the winds of the Cape of Storms. Once voted the no.! most popular place to visit in 1652
            by Jan Van Riebeeck ( VOC), and they are well - travelled individuals ( Home to work and back again mostly).<br /><br /> We once formed a vigilante super hero group called ‚Äú The Wordsmiths‚Äù
            but disbanded at the end of the month. None of ‚ÄúThe Wordsmiths‚Äù were billionaires (who could afford fancy gadgets) or orphans or any sort of super power but was rumoured to be able to stop
            a bullet at least once.<br /><br />Medication dependant, at the right dose, between naps, we will give you service of value. We were once rated ourselves 4.6 stars (we think we over
            rated!).<br /><br />With highly equipped standard occasionally fully functional upgraded Windows 8 software programmed computer system with a very low speeded internet connection and
            refurbished dot Matrix printer. We can almost find any picture you found.<br /><br />
            Customer satisfaction is occasionally guaranteed so if the artists connects with you he/she will answer all questions in interpretive dance.<br /><br />
            We also always almost have a lifeguard on duty so the chances of you drowning while getting tattooed is "very slim"<br /><br />

          <h2>Clinton's Hard Life</h2>
          <p>
            Clinton grew up in the suburbs in a three bedroom house being paid for by his hard working married mother and father. Being the middle sibling to Daleen and Karen who eventually ended with
            his own room for privacy. <br /><br />
            <Image src={kennetjieChamp} alt="Kennetjie Champion 1994" class="inline-image br-70" /> As his rebellious teenage years came upon, he joined a soccer team at the local sports district. Years
            after realizing he wasn't any good at that sport he joined the (much debatable and questionable) kennetjie squad where he excelled above average expectations. <br /><br />
            He dropped out of school after finishing Matric and having "girls, boys, veg, fruit" runners-up certificate, trick-shot kerem board gold medal as well as Western Province Kennetjie colours
            he pursued more accolades. Training vigorously with German-like precision and Italian-like passion to be the best at all sports eventually he surrendered, after finding out that he could just
            buy any trophy at his local 'trophy shop". <br /><br />
            This period in his life has brought him into the dark world of "under ground" scrabble which he took to the streets playing anyone and anywhere. After counselling he had to give up that addiction
            as it was consuming him to his core, (he once made the word "bedazzled" sacrificing a blank for a "z", getting the 50 points extra including a "triple word" score) those were the dark days.
            <br /><br /> After 2 weeks of being a vegetarian someone told him that chicken was not a vegetable.
            <br /><br /> He is now into secretive adult games in the evening, namely blood pressure , blood pressure 115/ 78 and sugar level, sugar level
